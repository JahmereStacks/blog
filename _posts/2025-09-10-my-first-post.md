Start of the summer , end of junior year... Failed track season. Senior year loading.. but its first its SUMMERR TIMEE!!
<br>
Ready to get straight to a paycheck starting july 1st the endless-headache of a cycle begins of me rising and shining, Eating all i can eat , Work at a daycare and practice like my life was on the line, get home at 10pm and Repeat. Very fun schedule, cant you tell? 
<br>
<h3>First day of Work</h3>
First day i do my daily stop to my corner store deli. "Let me get a
<b>B-A-C-O-N-E-G-G-N-C-H-E-E-S-E</b>".
along with the sandwhich i got some gum, cranberry juice and 2 bags of cheese itz.
9:00am sharp we arrived at the daycare waiting to be placed into classrooms as assistants and helpers. I was placed with my long time Friend from kindergarten as assistants.... They have noo idea. After meeting the teacher we were placed with and the 2nd teacher who we became very connected to for the next few weeks we did alot of work like decorating and making boards, redecorating and cleaning the classroom, feeding and teaching children and helping other staff with events for the kids.
<br>
Throughout the 6 weeks of SYEP i met new friends, made new connecting with my co-workers all while making money. After all the tables , chairs , plates of food that were carried up 3 flights of stairs, all the toys that we built for the kids, down to cleaning their cubbies were worth it because of the fun memories that were made!

Around 7pm Coach arrives and we get straight to warming up all while being yelled at. Mid-Way through the workout my teamate decides to ask if were gonna be running this summer...
<br>

<br>
Thank GOODNESS the answer was no, well not until the end of the 6 week summer training.
The workout consisted of our 30m-1h warmup, 4 sets of hanstring crawls to the 50 yard line on the football field, isometrics, backside mechanic training, pylometrics and to finish it off we got a core circuit and a cool down skip. Although it felt like hell the next 6 weeks of practice, the work will refelct when the season starts back up.

<h2>Summer Fun Time</h2>
Besides practice and working all summer, i actually had time to go out and have fun with family and friends. One of the things i did over the summer with family was going out to eat and the squid game experience in manhattan. We took picktures , Ate alot of food at bbq's and even lost terribly in the squid game experience, it was very fun though.
<br>
<br>
Another thing i did over the summer is go to puerto rico. Very fun trip, i had a blast even tho it was only for 2 days. I tried out new things and still didnt learn how to swim!. I went to the beach , jetsking (i cant even swim) and had fun with my cousins. After all those fun activites we went to our family memebers house and cooked and ate good food.

<h3>Bye summer, Hello Senior Year!</h3>
As summer comes to an end everyday day closer to the first day of school/ senior year, in my head im thinking to myself i genuinely dont want to go back to school.
But on the flip side im definitly ready to end and get out of highschool and start making big bucks $$. Only thing's im looking forward too during the school year is my birthday, graduation and possibly our senior trip (depending on where we decide to go).
